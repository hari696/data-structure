Scrabble
Misa is playing scrabble with her smaller sister. In this game, each tile contains a lowercase letter written on it.
Her smaller sister has a number of tiles and she gives them to Misa so that she can form a word using all of them.
Count how many words can be formed from the given tiles (the words may or may not make sense).
Input Format
The first line of input contains t which gives the number of test cases. Each test case contains one line which contains a
string of letters that denote the tiles Misa’s younger sister gives to her.
Output Format
The output contains t lines where each line contains the number of words that can be formed from the given tiles using all of them.
Constraints
1<=t<=10000
2<=n<=1000, where n denotes the number of tiles given to Misa by her sister.
Sample Input
3
cat
tiger
aab
Sample Output
6
120
3
Explanation
For the first test case, the tiles are ‘c’,’a’ and ‘t’. From these 3 letters, the following words can be formed are act, atc, cat, cta, tac, tca.
Therefore, total number of words that can be formed from these tiles is 6.
Similarly for the second test case. For the third test case, the unique words that can be formed are aab, aba and baa. So the output is 3.
Instructions
The dashboard provides two modes.
Test runs your code against public/sample test cases.
Submit runs against private/hidden ones.
Only public/sample test cases and their elaborate "test" results are made available. A line by line comparison with expected output is shown. There is no score for passing the public test cases. It's only for testing and debugging.
For the private/hidden test cases, the judging system only shows the exit code, passed status, time consumption, memory consumption and score. We expect users to take cues from these values. Only making a "submit" will yield a score. Total score is a normalized weighted score over all test cases.
